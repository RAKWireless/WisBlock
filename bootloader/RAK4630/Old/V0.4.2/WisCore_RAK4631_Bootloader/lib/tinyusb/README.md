TinyUSB is an open-source cross-platform USB Host/Device stack for embedded system, designed to be memory-safe with no dynamic allocation and thread-safe with all interrupt events are deferred then handled in the non-ISR task function.

[CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file for the list of all contributors and their awesome work for the stack.

## Supported MCUs

The stack supports the following MCUs:

- **Dialog:** DA1469x
- **Espressif:** ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3
- **MicroChip:** SAMD11, SAMD21, SAMD51, SAME5x, SAMG55, SAML21, SAML22, SAME7x
- **NordicSemi:** nRF52833, nRF52840
- **Nuvoton:** NUC120, NUC121/NUC125, NUC126, NUC505
- **NXP:**
  - iMX RT Series: RT1011, RT1015, RT1021, RT1052, RT1062, RT1064
  - Kinetis: KL25
  - LPC Series: 11u, 13, 15, 17, 18, 40, 43, 51u, 54, 55

[Here is the list of supported Boards](docs/boards.md) that can be used with provided examples.

## Device Stack

Supports multiple device configurations by dynamically changing usb descriptors. Low power functions such like suspend, resume, and remote wakeup. Following device classes are supported:

- Audio Class 2.0 (UAC2)
- Bluetooth Host Controller Interface (BTH HCI)
- Communication Class (CDC)
- Device Firmware Update (DFU): DFU mode (WIP) and Runtinme 
- Human Interface Device (HID): Generic (In & Out), Keyboard, Mouse, Gamepad etc ...
- Mass Storage Class (MSC): with multiple LUNs
- Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
- Network with RNDIS, CDC-ECM (work in progress)
- USB Test and Measurement Class (USBTMC)
- Vendor-specific class support with generic In & Out endpoints. Can be used with MS OS 2.0 compatible descriptor to load winUSB driver without INF file.
- [WebUSB](https://github.com/WICG/webusb) with vendor-specific class

If you have special need, `usbd_app_driver_get_cb()` can be used to write your own class driver without modifying the stack. Here is how RPi team add their reset interface [raspberrypi/pico-sdk#197](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/pull/197)

## Host Stack

**Most active development is on the Device stack. The Host stack is under rework and largely untested.**

- Human Interface Device (HID): Keyboard, Mouse, Generic
- Mass Storage Class (MSC)
- Hub currently only supports 1 level of hub (due to my laziness)

## OS Abstraction layer

TinyUSB is completely thread-safe by pushing all ISR events into a central queue, then process it later in the non-ISR context task function. It also uses semaphore/mutex to access shared resources such as CDC FIFO. Therefore the stack needs to use some of OS's basic APIs. Following OSes are already supported out of the box.

- **No OS**
- **FreeRTOS**
- **Mynewt** Due to the newt package build system, Mynewt examples are better to be on its [own repo](https://github.com/hathach/mynewt-tinyusb-example) 

## Getting Started

[Here are the details for getting started](docs/getting_started.md) with the stack.
